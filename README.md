#### 1. @CrossOrigin:
This annotation is used both at class and method level to enable cross origin requests. In many cases the host that serves JavaScript will be different from the host that serves the data. In such a case Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enables cross-domain communication.
````java
@CrossOrigin(maxAge = 3600)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://example.com")
@RequestMapping("/message")
  public Message getMessage() {
      // ...
    }
 
@RequestMapping("/note")
    public Note getNote() {
        // ...
    }
}
````
#### 2. @InitBinder
The @InitBinder annotated methods will get called for each HTTP request if you donâ€™t specify the value element of this annotation. The value element can be a single or multiple form names or request parameters that the init binder method is applied to.
This annotation is a method level annotation that plays the role of identifying the methods which initialize the WebDataBinder - a DataBinder that binds the request parameter to JavaBean objects.

#### 3. @Cacheable
This annotation is used on methods. The simplest way of enabling the cache behaviour for a method is to annotate it with @Cacheable and parameterize it with the name of the cache where the results would be stored.
````java
@Cacheable("addresses")
public String getAddress(Book book){...}
````
In the snippet above , the method getAddress is associated with the cache named addresses. Each time the method is called, the cache is checked to see whether the invocation has been already executed and does not have to be repeated.

#### H2-db default path
`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
if we mention spring.h2.console.path=/pathname
then use pathname
`http://localhost:8080/pathname`
